With respect to the theory of robust optimization, this paper reviews recent results on the cases without and with recourse, i.e., the static and dynamic settings, as well as the connection with stochastic optimization and risk theory, the concept of distributionally robust optimization, and findings in robust nonlinear optimization. With respect to the practice of robust optimization, we consider a broad spectrum of applications, in particular inventory and logistics, finance, revenue management, but also queueing networks, machine learning, energy systems and the public good. Key developments in the period from 2007 to present include: (i) an extensive body of work on robust decision-making under uncertainty with uncertain distributions, i.e., "robustifying" stochastic optimization, (ii) a greater connection with decision sciences by linking uncertainty sets to risk theory, (iii) further results on nonlinear optimization and sequential decision-making and (iv) besides more work on established families of examples such as robust inventory and revenue management, the addition to the robust optimization literature of new application areas, especially energy systems and the public good. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It then develops the robust optimization theory for uncertain conic quadratic and semidefinite optimization problems and dynamic (multistage) problems.

We present a branch-and-bound LP outer approximation algorithm for an MI-convex problem transformed to MI-conic form. The polyhedral relaxations are refined with \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts derived from conic certificates for continuous primal-dual conic subproblems. Under the assumption that all subproblems are well-posed, the algorithm detects infeasibility or unboundedness or returns an optimal solution in finite time. Using properties of the conic certificates, we show that the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts imply certain practically-relevant guarantees about the quality of the polyhedral relaxations, and demonstrate how to maintain helpful guarantees when the LP solver uses a positive feasibility tolerance. We discuss how to disaggregate \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts in order to tighten the polyhedral relaxations and thereby improve the speed of convergence, and propose fast heuristic methods of obtaining useful \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts. Our new open source MI-conic solver Pajarito (http://github.com/JuliaOpt/Pajarito.jl) uses an external mixed-integer linear (MILP) solver to manage the search tree and an external continuous conic solver for subproblems. Benchmarking on a library of mixed-integer second-order cone (MISOCP) problems, we find that Pajarito greatly outperforms Bonmin (the leading open source alternative) and is competitive with CPLEX's specialized MISOCP algorithm. We demonstrate the robustness of Pajarito by solving diverse MI-conic problems involving mixtures of positive semidefinite, second-order, and exponential cones, and provide evidence for the practical value of our analyses and enhancements of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}{\textasciicircum}*\$ cuts.},

	abstract = {A robust approach to solving linear optimization problems with uncertain data was proposed in the early 1970s and has recently been extensively studied and extended. Under this approach, we are willing to accept a suboptimal solution for the nominal values of the data in order to ensure that the solution remains feasible and near optimal when the data changes. A concern with such an approach is that it might be too conservative. In this paper, we propose an approach that attempts to make this trade-off more attractive; that is, we investigate ways to decrease what we call the price of robustness. In particular, we flexibly adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solutions in terms of probabilistic bounds of constraint violations. An attractive aspect of our method is that the new robust formulation is also a linear optimization problem. Thus we naturally extend our methods to discrete optimization problems in a tractable way. We report numerical results for a portfolio optimization problem, a knapsack problem, and a problem from the Net Lib library.},

Our framework begins by first affinely extending the set of primitive uncertainties to generate new linear decision rules of larger dimensions and is therefore more flexible. Next, we develop new piecewise-linear decision rules that allow a more flexible reformulation of the original problem. The reformulated problem will generally contain terms with expectations on the positive parts of the recourse variables. Finally, we convert the uncertain linear program into a deterministic convex program by constructing distributionally robust bounds on these expectations. These bounds are constructed by first using different pieces of information on the distribution of the underlying uncertainties to develop separate bounds and next integrating them into a combined bound that is better than each of the individual bounds. {\textcopyright} 2010 INFORMS.},

	doi = {10.1287/opre.1110.0950},
	abstract = {In this paper we develop tight bounds on the expected values of several risk measures that are of interest to us. This work is motivated by the robust optimization models arising from portfolio selection problems. Indeed, the whole paper is centered around robust portfolio models and solutions. The basic setting is to find a portfolio that maximizes (respectively, minimizes) the expected utility (respectively, disutility) values in the midst of infinitely many possible ambiguous distributions of the investment returns fitting the given mean and variance estimations. First, we show that the single-stage portfolio selection problem within this framework, whenever the disutility function is in the form of lower partial moments (LPM), or conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), or value-at-risk (VaR), can be solved analytically. The results lead to the solutions for single-stage robust portfolio selection models. Furthermore, the results also lead to a multistage adjustable robust optimization (ARO) solution when the disutility function is the second-order LPM. Exploring beyond the confines of convex optimization, we also consider the so-called S-shaped value function, which plays a key role in the prospect theory of Kahneman and Tversky. The nonrobust version of the problem is shown to be NP-hard in general. However, we present an efficient procedure for solving the robust counterpart of the same portfolio selection problem. In this particular case, the consideration of the robustness actually helps to reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we consider the situation whereby we have some additional information about the chance that a quadratic function of the random distribution reaches a certain threshold. That information helps to further reduce the ambiguity in the robust model. We show that the robust optimization problem in that case can be solved by means of semidefinite programming (SDP), if no more than two additional chance inequalities are to be incorporated. {\textcopyright} 2011 INFORMS.},

The adaptive distributionally robust optimization framework caters for dynamic decision making, where decisions adapt to the uncertain outcomes as they unfold in stages. For tractability considerations, we focus on a class of second-order conic (SOC) representable ambiguity set, though our results can easily be extended to more general conic representations. We show that the adaptive distributionally robust linear optimization problem can be formulated as a classical robust optimization problem. To obtain a tractable formulation, we approximate the adaptive distributionally robust optimization problem using linear decision rule (LDR) techniques. More interestingly, by incorporating the primary and auxiliary random variables of the lifted ambiguity set in the LDR approximation,we can significantly improve the solutions, and for a class of adaptive distributionally robust optimization problems, exact solutions can also be obtained. Using the new LDR approximation, we can transform the distributionally adaptive robust optimization problem to a classical robust optimization problem with an SOC representable uncertainty set. Finally, to demonstrate the potential for solving management decision problems, we develop an algebraic modeling package and illustrate how it can be used to facilitate modeling and obtain high-quality solutions for medical appointment scheduling and inventory management problems.},

In particular, we consider the case in which the distribution of the input is unknown, yet there is some historical data drawn from the distribution. In this paper, we propose a new type of distributionally robust optimization model called the likelihood robust optimization (LRO) model for this class of problems. In contrast to previous work on distributionally robust optimization that focuses on certain parameters (e.g., mean, variance, etc.) of the input distribution, we exploit the historical data and define the accessible distribution set to contain only those distributions that make the observed data achieve a certain level of likelihood. Then we formulate the targeting problem as one of optimizing the expected value of the objective function under the worst-case distribution in that set. Our model avoids the over-conservativeness of some prior robust approaches by ruling out unrealistic distributions while maintaining robustness of the solution for any statistically likely outcomes. We present statistical analyses of our model using Bayesian statistics and empirical likelihood theory. Specifically, we prove the asymptotic behavior of our distribution set and establish the relationship between our model and other distributionally robust models. To test the performance of our model, we apply it to the newsvendor problem and the portfolio selection problem. The test results show that the solutions of our model indeed have desirable performance.},

We first show that a DRCCP can be reformulated as a conditional value-at-risk constrained optimization problem, and thus admits tight inner and outer approximations. We also show that a DRCCP of bounded feasible region is mixed integer representable by introducing big-M coefficients and additional binary variables. For a DRCCP with pure binary decision variables, by exploring the submodular structure, we show that it admits a big-M free formulation, which can be solved by a branch and cut algorithm.

	abstract = {Optimization problems with constraints involving stochastic parameters that are required to be satisfied with a prespecified probability threshold arise in numerous applications. Such chance constrained optimization problems involve the dual challenges of stochasticity and nonconvexity. In the setting of a finite distribution of the stochastic parameters, an optimization problem with linear chance constraints can be formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The natural MILP formulation has a weak relaxation bound and is quite difficult to solve. In this paper, we review some recent results on improving the relaxation bounds and constructing approximate solutions for MILP formulations of chance constraints. We also discuss a recently introduced bicriteria approximation algorithm for covering type chance constrained problems. This algorithm uses a relaxation to construct a solution whose (constraint violation) risk level may be larger than the pre-specified threshold, but is within a constant factor of it, and whose objective value is also within a constant factor of the true optimal value. Finally, we present some new results that improve on the bicriteria approximation factors in the finite scenario setting and shed light on the effect of strong relaxations on the approximation ratios.},

	abstract = {The uncertainty associated with renewable energy sources introduces significant challenges in optimal power flow (OPF) analysis. A variety of new approaches have been proposed that use chance constraints to limit line or bus overload risk in OPF models. Most existing formulations assume that the probability distributions associated with the uncertainty are known a priori or can be estimated accurately from empirical data, and/or use separate chance constraints for upper and lower line/bus limits. In this paper, we propose a data driven distributionally robust chance constrained optimal power flow model (DRCC-OPF), which ensures that the worst-case probability of violating both the upper and lower limit of a line/bus capacity under a wide family of distributions is small. Assuming that we can estimate the first and second moments of the underlying distributions based on empirical data, we propose an exact reformulation of DRCC-OPF as a tractable convex program. The key theoretical result behind this reformulation is a second-order cone programming (SOCP) reformulation of a general two-sided distributionally robust chance constrained set by lifting the set to a higher dimensional space. Our numerical study shows that the proposed SOCP formulation can be solved efficiently and that the results of our model are quite robust.},

	abstract = {A joint chance constrained optimization problem involves multiple uncertain constraints, i.e., constraints with stochastic parameters, that are jointly required to be satisfied with probability exceeding a prespecified threshold. In a distributionally robust joint chance constrained optimization problem (DRCCP), the joint chance constraint is required to hold for all probability distributions of the stochastic parameters from a given ambiguity set. In this work, we consider DRCCPs involving convex nonlinear uncertain constraints and an ambiguity set specified by convex moment constraints. We investigate deterministic reformulations of such problems and conditions under which such deterministic reformulations are convex. In particular we show that a DRCCP can be reformulated as a convex program if one the following conditions hold: (i) there is a single uncertain constraint, (ii) the ambiguity set is defined by a single moment constraint, (iii) the ambiguity set is defined by linear moment constraints, and (iv) the uncertain and moment constraints are positively homogeneous with respect to uncertain parameters. We further show that if the decision variables are binary and the uncertain constraints are linear then a DRCCP can be reformulated as a deterministic mixed integer convex program. Finally, we present a numerical study to illustrate that the proposed mixed integer convex reformulation can be solved efficiently by existing solvers.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10107-019-01442-8},
	abstract = {A distributionally robust joint chance constraint involves a set of uncertain linear inequalities which can be violated up to a given probability threshold $\epsilon$, over a given family of probability distributions of the uncertain parameters. A conservative approximation of a joint chance constraint, often referred to as a Bonferroni approximation, uses the union bound to approximate the joint chance constraint by a system of single chance constraints, one for each original uncertain constraint, for a fixed choice of violation probabilities of the single chance constraints such that their sum does not exceed $\epsilon$. It has been shown that, under various settings, a distributionally robust single chance constraint admits a deterministic convex reformulation. Thus the Bonferroni approximation approach can be used to build convex approximations of distributionally robust joint chance constraints. In this paper we consider an optimized version of Bonferroni approximation where the violation probabilities of the individual single chance constraints are design variables rather than fixed a priori. We show that such an optimized Bonferroni approximation of a distributionally robust joint chance constraint is exact when the uncertainties are separable across the individual inequalities, i.e., each uncertain constraint involves a different set of uncertain parameters and corresponding distribution families. Unfortunately, the optimized Bonferroni approximation leads to NP-hard optimization problems even in settings where the usual Bonferroni approximation is tractable. When the distribution family is specified by moments or by marginal distributions, we derive various sufficient conditions under which the optimized Bonferroni approximation is convex and tractable. We also show that for moment based distribution families and binary decision variables, the optimized Bonferroni approximation can be reformulated as a mixed integer second-order conic set. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be used to derive a convex reformulation of a distributionally robust joint chance constraint with a specific non-separable distribution family.},

	doi = {10.1287/opre.2019.1866},
	abstract = {A chance-constrained optimization problem involves constraints with random data that can be violated with probability bounded from above by a prespecified small risk parameter. Such constraints are used to model reliability requirements in a variety of application areas, such as finance, energy, service, and manufacturing. Except under very special conditions, chance-constrained problems are extremely difficult. There has been a great deal of elegant work on developing tractable approximations of chance constraints. Unfortunately, none of these approaches comes with a constant factor approximation guarantee. We show that such a guarantee is impossible by proving an inapproximability result. By contrast, for a large class of chance-constrained covering problems, we propose a bicriteria approximation scheme. Our scheme finds a solution whose violation probability may be larger than but is within a constant factor of the specified risk parameter and whose objective value is within a constant factor of the true optimal value. Key to our developments is the construction of a tractable convex relaxation of a chance-constrained problem and an appropriate scaling of a solution to this relaxation. We extend our approximation results to the setting in which the underlying distribution of the constraint data is not known. That is, we consider distributionally robust chance-constrained covering problems with convex moment and Wasserstein ambiguity sets and provide bicriteria approximation results.},

The state-of-the-art methods for solving the resulting distributionally robust optimization problems rely on global optimization techniques, which quickly become computationally excruciating. In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, the distributionally robust optimization problems over Wasserstein balls can in fact be reformulated as finite convex programs{\textemdash}in many interesting cases even as tractable linear programs. Leveraging recent measure concentration results, we also show that their solutions enjoy powerful finite-sample performance guarantees.

Furthermore, optimal solutions to these problems enjoy a strong, finite-sample probabilistic guarantee whenever the constraints and objective function are concave in the uncertainty.

The distribution is then assumed to belong to an ambiguity set comprising all distributions that are compatible with the decision maker's prior information. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework for modeling and solving distributionally robust optimization problems. We introduce standardized ambiguity sets that contain all distributions with prescribed conic representable confidence sets and with mean values residing on an affine manifold. These ambiguity sets are highly expressive and encompass many ambiguity sets from the recent literature as special cases. They also allow us to characterize distributional families in terms of several classical and/or robust statistical indicators that have not yet been studied in the context of robust optimization. We determine conditions under which distributionally robust optimization problems based on our standardized ambiguity sets are computationally tractable. We also provide tractable conservative approximations for problems that violate these conditions.},

Such problems frequently occur in, for example, optimization problems in inventory control or finance that involve terms containing moments of random variables, expected utility, etc. We show that the robust counterpart of a linear optimization problem with $\varphi$-divergence uncertainty is tractable for most of the choices of $\varphi$ typically considered in the literature.

However, in practice, it is often difficult to completely characterize the demand distribution, especially in fast-changing markets. In this paper, we study the newsvendor problem with partial information about the demand distribution (e.g., mean, variance, symmetry, unimodality). In particular, we derive the order quantities that minimize the newsvendor's maximum regret of not acting optimally. Most of our solutions are tractable, which makes them attractive for practical application. Our analysis also generates insights into the choice of the demand distribution as an input to the newsvendor model. In particular, the distributions that maximize the entropy perform well under the regret criterion. Our approach can be extended to a variety of problems that require a robust but not conservative solution.},

These bounds are not sharp if the underlying distributions possess additional structural properties, including symmetry, unimodality, convexity, or smoothness.

For the single stock problem, given moments of the prices of the underlying assets, we show that we can find best-possible bounds on option prices with general payoff functions efficiently, either algorithmically (solving a semidefinite optimization problem) or in closed form. Conversely, given observable option prices, we provide best-possible bounds on moments of the prices of the underlying assets, as well as on the prices of other options on the same asset by solving linear optimization problems. For options that are affected by multiple stocks either directly (the payoff of the option depends on multiple stocks) or indirectly (we have information on correlations between stock prices), we find nonoptimal bounds using convex optimization methods. However, we show that it is NP-hard to find best possible bounds in multiple dimensions. We extend our results to incorporate transactions costs.},

We prove that for a general class of objective functions, the robust solutions amount to solving a certain deterministic parametric quadratic program. We first prove a general projection property for multivariate distributions with given means and covariances, which reduces our problem to optimizing a univariate mean-variance robust objective. This allows us to use known univariate results in the multidimensional setting, and to add new results in this direction. In particular, we characterize a general class of objective functions (the so-called one- or two-point support functions), for which the robust objective is reduced to a deterministic optimization problem in one variable. Finally, we adapt a result from Geoffrion (1967a) to reduce the main problem to a parametric quadratic program. In particular, our results are true for increasing concave utilities with convex or concave-convex derivatives. Closed-form solutions are obtained for special discontinuous criteria, motivated by bonus- and commission-based incentive schemes for portfolio management. We also investigate a multiproduct pricing application, which motivates extensions of our results for the case of nonnegative and decision-dependent returns.},

In spite of its popularity in practice, there does not exist any analysis on the convergence rates of this method. In this paper, we first establish the number of iterations, i.e., iteration complexity, required by a basic dual dynamic programming method for solving single-scenario multi-stage optimization problems, by introducing novel mathematical tools including the saturation of search points. We then refine these basic tools and establish the iteration complexity for an explorative dual dynamic programing method proposed herein and the classic stochastic dual dynamic programming method for solving more general multi-stage stochastic optimization problems under the standard stage-wise independence assumption. Our results indicate that the complexity of these methods mildly increases with the number of stages T, in fact linearly dependent on T for discounted problems. Therefore, they are efficient for strategic decision making which involves a large number of stages, but with a relatively small number of decision variables in each stage. Without explicitly discretizing the state and action spaces, these methods might also be pertinent to the related reinforcement learning and stochastic control areas.},

This problem may happen to be computationally intractable; our goal is to build its computationally tractable approximation, i.e., an efficiently solvable deterministic optimization program with the feasible set contained in the chance constrained problem. We construct a general class of such convex conservative approximations of the corresponding chance constrained problem. Moreover, under the assumptions that the constraints are affine in the perturbations and the entries in the perturbation vector are independent-of-each-other random variables, we build a large deviation-type approximation, referred to as {\textquotedblleft}Bernstein approximation,{\textquotedblright} of the chance constrained problem. This approximation is convex and efficiently solvable. We propose a simulation-based scheme for bounding the optimal value in the chance constrained problem and report numerical experiments aimed at comparing the Bernstein and well-known scenario approximation approaches. Finally, we extend our construction to the case of ambiguous chance constrained problems, where the random perturbations are independent with the collection of distributions known to belong to a given convex compact set rather than to be known exactly, while the chance constraint should be satisfied for every distribution given by this set.},

	abstract = {The stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) algorithm has become one of the main tools used to address convex multistage stochastic optimal control problems. Recently a large amount of work has been devoted to improving the convergence speed of the algorithm through cut selection and regularization, and to extending the field of applications to nonlinear, integer, or risk-averse problems. However, one of the main downsides of the algorithm remains the difficulty in giving an upper bound of the optimal value, usually estimated through Monte Carlo methods and therefore difficult to use in the stopping criterion of the algorithm. In this paper we present a dual SDDP algorithm that yields a converging exact upper bound for the optimal value of the optimization problem. As an easy consequence of our approach, we show how to compute an alternative control policy based on an inner approximation of Bellman value functions instead of the outer approximation given by the standard SDDP algorithm. We illustrate the approach on an energy production problem involving zones of production and transportation links between the zones. The numerical experiments we carry out on this example show the effectiveness of the method.},

	abstract = {We study a multilocation newsvendor model with a retailer owning multiple retail stores, each of which is operated by a manager who decides the order quantity for filling random customer demand of a product. Store managers and the retailer are all risk averse, but managers are more risk averse than the retailer. We adopt conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as the performance measure and consider two alternative strategies to improve the system{\textquoteright}s performance. First, the retailer centralizes the ordering decisions. Second, managers still decide the order quantity for their own store, whereas their inventories are pooled together. We analyze and compare the optimal order quantities and the resultant CVaR values of the systems and study their comparative statistics. For centralization, we find that each store has a higher inventory level in the centralized system than in the decentralized system, and centralization positively benefits the retailer as long as some store managers are strictly more risk averse than the retailer. When there is inventory pooling, the ordering decisions in the decentralized system depend on how the additional profit from pooling is allocated among the stores. We consider a weighted proportional allocation rule and characterize the Nash equilibrium of the resultant ordering game among the store managers. Our key finding is that as long as the store managers are sufficiently more risk averse than the retailer or the demands are very heavy tailed, inventory pooling is less beneficial than centralization. We further derive a lower bound on the value of centralization and two upper bounds on the value of inventory pooling. Finally, our analytical results are illustrated using a data set from an online retailer in China, and various comparative statics are further examined via extensive numerical experiments.

	abstract = {Multistage stochastic programming deals with operational and planning problems that involve a sequence of decisions over time while responding to an uncertain future. Algorithms designed to address multistage stochastic linear programming (MSLP) problems often rely upon scenario trees to represent the underlying stochastic process. When this process exhibits stagewise independence, sampling-based techniques, particularly the stochastic dual dynamic programming algorithm, have received wide acceptance. However, these sampling-based methods still operate with a deterministic representation of the problem which uses the so-called sample average approximation. In this work, we present a sequential sampling approach for MSLP problems that allows the decision process to assimilate newly sampled data recursively. We refer to this method as the stochastic dynamic linear programming (SDLP) algorithm. Since we use sequential sampling, the algorithm does not necessitate a priori representation of uncertainty, through either a scenario tree or sample average approximation, both of which require a knowledge/estimation of the underlying distribution. This method constitutes a generalization of the stochastic decomposition algorithm for two-stage stochastic linear programming models. The approximations used within SDLP may be viewed either through the lens of proximal methods or via regularization. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of basic feasible policies which provide a piecewise affine solution discovery scheme, which is embedded within the optimization algorithm to identify incumbent solutions used in the context of proximal iterations. Finally, we show that the SDLP algorithm provides a sequence of decisions and corresponding value function estimates along a sequence of state trajectories that asymptotically converge to their optimal counterparts, with probability one.},

	abstract = {We consider dynamic selection problems, where a decision maker repeatedly selects a set of items from a larger collection of available items. A classic example is the dynamic assortment problem with demand learning, where a retailer chooses items to offer for sale subject to a display space constraint. The retailer may adjust the assortment over time in response to the observed demand. These dynamic selection problems are naturally formulated as stochastic dynamic programs (DPs) but are difficult to solve because the optimal selection decisions depend on the states of all items. In this paper, we study heuristic policies for dynamic selection problems and provide upper bounds on the performance of an optimal policy that can be used to assess the performance of a heuristic policy. The policies and bounds that we consider are based on a Lagrangian relaxation of the DP that relaxes the constraint limiting the number of items that may be selected. We characterize the performance of the Lagrangian index policy and bound and show that, under mild conditions, these policies and bounds are asymptotically optimal for problems with many items; mixed policies and tiebreaking play an essential role in the analysis of these index policies and can have a surprising impact on performance. We demonstrate these policies and bounds in two large scale examples: a dynamic assortment problem with demand learning and an applicant screening problem.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a Benders decomposition algorithm capable of efficiently solving large-scale instances of the well-known multicommodity capacitated network design problem with demand uncertainty. The problem is important because it models many applications, including telecommunications, transportation, and logistics. This problem has been tackled in the literature with metaheuristics and exact methods, but many benchmark instances, even though of moderate size, remain unsolved. To successfully apply the Benders method to these instances, we propose various acceleration techniques, including the use of cutting planes, partial decomposition, heuristics, stronger cuts, reduction and warm-start strategies. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances were conducted to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm as well as of the proposed strategies. The numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing ones.},

We develop a decomposition algorithm in which the first-stage approximation is solved by a branchand-bound algorithm with its nodes inheriting Benders{\textquoteright} cuts that are valid for their ancestor nodes. In addition, we develop two closely related convexification schemes which use multi-term disjunctive cuts to obtain approximations of the second-stage mixed-integer programs. We prove that the proposed methods are finitely convergent. One of the main advantages of our decomposition scheme is that we use a Benders-based branch-and-cut approach in which linear programming approximations are strengthened sequentially. Moreover as in many decomposition schemes, these subproblems can be solved in parallel. We also illustrate these algorithms using several variants of an SMIP example from the literature, as well as a new set of test problems, which we refer to as Stochastic Server Location and Sizing. Finally, we present our computational experience with previously known examples as well as the new collection of SMIP instances. Our experiments reveal that our algorithm is able to produce provably optimal solutions (within an hour of CPU time) even in instances for which a highly reliable commercial MIP solver is unable to provide an optimal solution within an hour of CPU time.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13278v4},
	abstract = {In this paper, we study multistage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MS-MINLP). This general class of problems encompasses, as important special cases, multistage stochastic convex optimization with non-Lipschitzian value functions and multistage stochastic mixed-integer linear optimization. We develop stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) type algorithms with nested decomposition, deterministic sampling, and stochastic sampling. The key ingredient is a new type of cuts based on generalized conjugacy. Several interesting classes of MS-MINLP are identified, where the new algorithms are guaranteed to obtain the global optimum without the assumption of complete recourse. This significantly generalizes the classic SDDP algorithms. We also characterize the iteration complexity of the proposed algorithms. In particular, for a \$(T+1)\$-stage stochastic MINLP with \$d\$-dimensional state spaces, to obtain an \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-optimal root node solution, we prove that the number of iterations of the proposed deterministic sampling algorithm is upper bounded by \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(({\textbackslash}frac\{2T\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\}){\textasciicircum}d)\$, and is lower bounded by \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(({\textbackslash}frac\{T\}\{4{\textbackslash}epsilon\}){\textasciicircum}d)\$ for the general case or by \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(({\textbackslash}frac\{T\}\{8{\textbackslash}epsilon\}){\textasciicircum}\{d/2-1\})\$ for the convex case. This shows that the obtained complexity bounds are rather sharp. It also reveals that the iteration complexity depends polynomially on the number of stages. We further show that the iteration complexity depends linearly on \$T\$, if all the state spaces are finite sets, or if we seek a \$(T{\textbackslash}epsilon)\$-optimal solution when the state spaces are infinite sets, i.e. allowing the optimality gap to scale with \$T\$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reports global optimization algorithms as well as iteration complexity results for solving such a large class of multistage stochastic programs.},

We compare the strength of the proposed dual bounds and demonstrate that they are superior to the bound obtained from the continuous relaxation of a standard mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation. For a given dual solution, the associated Lagrangian relaxation bounds can be calculated by solving a set of single scenario subproblems and then solving a single knapsack problem. We also derive two new primal MIP formulations and demonstrate that for chance-constrained linear programs, the continuous relaxations of these formulations yield bounds equal to the proposed dual bounds. We propose a new heuristic method and two new exact algorithms based on these duals and formulations. The first exact algorithm applies to chance-constrained binary programs, and uses either of the proposed dual bounds in concert with cuts that eliminate solutions found by the subproblems. The second exact method is a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving either of the primal formulations. Our computational results indicate that the proposed dual bounds and heuristic solutions can be obtained efficiently, and the gaps between the best dual bounds and the heuristic solutions are small.},

When C is multi-dimensional and $\varepsilon$ is small, like 10-6 or 10-10, this problem is, generically, a problem of minimizing under a nonconvex and difficult to compute constraint and as such is computationally intractable. We investigate the potential of conceptually simple scenario approximation of the chance constraint. That is, approximation of the form G(x, $\eta$j) ? C, j = 1, ..., N , where \{$\eta$j\}Nj=1 is a sample drawn from a properly chosen trial distribution. The emphasis is on the situation where the solution to the approximation should, with probability at least 1 - $\delta$, be feasible for the problem of interest, while the sample size N should be polynomial in the size of this problem and in ln(1/$\varepsilon$), ln(1/$\delta$).},
